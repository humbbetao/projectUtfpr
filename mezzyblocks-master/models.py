# NOTE: If caching of any kind (memcached or similar) is implemented, this
# should be kept there.  It doesn't matter if we loose this data, and it's
# only valid for 10 mins anyway.  It'll add extra load to the mysql database,
# etc.  For a proof of concept-level thing, that harly matters, so just
# shoving it in there for now.
#
# NOTE: Data here might be deleted *at will*.  In fact, it probably *should*
# be deleted every time fresh data is fetched, to avoid filling it with old
# crap.
# 
# NOTE: Rule of thumb for using:
#		* Delete *all* data more than 2 hours old for *all* places.
#       * Do we have any data that's less than 11 mins old?  Use it.
#       * Can we fetch data?  If so, use it, update cache, if not:
#       * Do we have any data less than 2 hours old?  Use it.
#       * Give up.
#
# Typical thing to toss in here would be:
#    place   = Norge/Hordaland/Bergen/Sandviken
#    updated = When the data was fetched
#    hour    = "10:30", which hour the data is for
#    thing   = "C" == Celcius
#	 value   = "4" == Number of degrees C
#
# NOTE: Since we won't accumulate logged data, we don't care too much about
# splitting place to a separate table, to keep columns shorter in this one.
# It would give us work, and gain nothing.
